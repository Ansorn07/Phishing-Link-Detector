# Phishing Link Detector üé£

A robust machine learning application built to combat phishing attacks by analyzing and classifying URLs with high accuracy.

## Description

This repository contains the source code for Phishing-Link-Detector, a system designed to identify malicious URLs. It uses comprehensive feature extraction from URLs and a trained classification model to predict whether a link is a phishing attempt, helping to ensure web safety.

-----

## üöÄ Key Features

  * **Advanced Feature Extraction:** Extracts over 30 distinct features from URLs to identify suspicious patterns indicative of phishing.
  * **Pre-Trained ML Model:** Utilizes a highly accurate, pre-trained classifier (`phishing_classifier.pkl`) for real-time predictions.
  * **Comprehensive Dataset Tools:** Includes scripts for generating and processing datasets, allowing for easy retraining and testing.
  * **Detailed Analysis:** Comes with a Jupyter Notebook (`new_training_after_data_generalization.ipynb`) that details the model training, evaluation, and data generalization process.

## ü§î How It Works

The detection process is straightforward yet powerful:

1.  **Input URL:** A user provides a URL for analysis.
2.  **Feature Extraction:** The system extracts a wide range of features from the URL. This includes analyzing the domain, path, special characters, and length.
3.  **Prediction:** The extracted features are fed into the pre-trained machine learning model.
4.  **Classification:** The model classifies the URL as either **Legitimate** or a **Phishing** attempt.

## üìã Examples

Here are some examples of how the detector classifies different types of links:

### üé£ Phishing Links

These links often impersonate legitimate websites to steal sensitive information.

| URL                                                | Prediction |
| -------------------------------------------------- | :--------: |
| `http://paypal.com.login.verify-user.abcxyz.ru/login` | **Phishing** |
| `http://update-your-bank-info.security-alert.net/` | **Phishing** |
| `http://secure-account.amazon.verify-user-check.in/` | **Phishing** |
| `http://apple.com.verify-id-urgent-reset.ga/login`   | **Phishing** |
| `http://facebook.com-security-check-2348.tk/update`  | **Phishing** |

### ‚úÖ Legitimate Links

These are examples of safe, well-known websites.

| URL                                                | Prediction  |
| -------------------------------------------------- | :---------: |
| `https://www.google.com`                           | **Legitimate** |
| `https://www.amazon.in`                            | **Legitimate** |
| `https://www.wikipedia.org`                        | **Legitimate** |
| `https://www.india.gov.in`                         | **Legitimate** |
| `https://www.rbi.org.in`                           | **Legitimate** |

## üß† Model

The core of this project is the pre-trained classification model stored in `phishing_classifier.pkl`. This model was trained on a diverse dataset of phishing and legitimate URLs and can be easily loaded for predictions.

For details on the training process, please see the `new_training_after_data_generalization.ipynb` notebook.
